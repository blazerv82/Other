-History of Shatterd- <br/>
This website used to be called Gamers Paradise, and it had big plans. It was going to be the best place for gamers and game creators alike to meet up and discuss things. Of course, back then, I had little to no knowledge of how to make that happen beyond basic HTML and CSS formattng.
Years past, and as my knowledge grew, so did my website not only in size, but in complexity. I at one point had a webcomic viewing system, but I unfortunately lost the code to that (probably a good thing too, the code was pretty messy). I started to think that maybe Gamers Paradise wasn't such a great name (a simple google search provides dozens of results for other paradises). So I got to thinking of a new name. Shatterd eventually stuck, with a small change in spelling.
Shatterd then became my own personal place on the web to share things I have made, or cool things I think others should see. I have changed things quite a bit, from a three column layout, to the layout you see now. And while it does look a lot different than what I had before, I am happy for the change. It really reflects what style I try to go for, as well as looking pretty damn slick.
