<div id='mainContent'><span id="header">Who is blazerv82? --</span>
I'm just a regular old guy who likes to do three very distinct things in my off-time. Music, Coding, and Art. I also build (and to an extent fix) computers, and like to collect older or rare tech. When I'm not doing any of the mentioned things, I'm probably playing games.
</div>

<div id='mainContent'><span id="header">You said music? --</span>
Yeah, I did. I play piano to an extent. As of writing, I have 65+ songs that I have made, and most are available to listen on my SoundCloud or everything can be found on this website (under the audio tab). All of my music (up to this point) as been completely made in LMMS.

<div id='mainContent'><span id="header">Coding? --</span>
This is something I haven't done in quite a while. In fact, I've been on hiatus ever since I left college but recently have been getting back into things. I do web-based things and Rainmeter for the most part. I'm also working on a text-based adventure game written completely in Javascript. I rarely do any other languages, though I have used Java and Processing before.

<div id='mainContent'><span id="header">Art? --</span>
A little of this, a little of that. I've done pretty much every medium, but fail to make anything I would consider 'worthy'. If I do, it's drawing with the old pencil and paper. I do have a drawing tablet as well. Otherwise, all of my art is limited to what I need to make for various computer-based projects. Like album art.
</div>

<div id='mainContent'><span id="header">What about the rest? --</span>
I really like building/fixing computers and collecting various parts to fix them. I have close to 4-5 towers as well as several laptops. Otherwise, I collect whatever else I can get. Cellphones, tablets, gaming consoles. Not many people can say they own a FirefoxOS phone (I wouldn't recommended it until it becomes much more widespread).<br/>
For gaming, I have a couple of DS's, my phones and computers. I play a widespread set of games, mostly focusing on racing and action-y type of games.
